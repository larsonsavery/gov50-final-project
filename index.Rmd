## Project thoughts

I want to dive into data from a recent federal election, probably related to  House of Representatives races and compare polls leading up to the election with the actual results. I want to combine US Census data with polling to create a large dataset of demographic, economic, or geographic variables. Then I want to investigate if trends in these variables make polls accurate or inaccurate at predicting election outcomes.
